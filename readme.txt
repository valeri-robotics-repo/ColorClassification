Extract the data from the zip file.  Update the paths to the location.

run coloridentify.py to create the model
run predict.py to predict the color.  The model was mostly trained on objects identified by an object identification model with a bounding box; it is expected that the object will be tight and centered.  It will tolerate different background colors.

I get the following results:
